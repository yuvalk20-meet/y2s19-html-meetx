<p>In the year 2030, fifty-two year old Ted Mosby sits his two teen-aged children down to tell them the story of how he met their mother. Despite his kids being disinterested, Ted proceeds with the story, which started twenty-five years earlier in 2005. Ted, just starting his career as an architect, was living in New York City with his best friend and Wesleyan University roommate Marshall Eriksen, a second year law student. Their life was just about to change as Marshall planned to propose to his longtime girlfriend, kindergarten teacher Lily Aldrin, who they also met at Wesleyan. As Ted, Marshall and Lily hung out together as a threesome, Ted felt he needed to find his own love, despite another of his friends, perpetual suit-wearing, blog-writing, womanizing Barney Stinson, telling him no one should get married before age thirty. Just then, Ted spotted across a crowded bar a beautiful woman who he believed was destined to be his wife. She is a dog-loving on-air reporter. They ended up going on a protracted first date which ended "unfinished". After getting advice from Marshall, Lily and Barney, Ted vowed to finish the date with a grand gesture, which ended up being a little grander in a psychotic way than he imagined it would be. Ted finishes this phase of the story by telling the kids that's how he met their "Aunt" Robin Scherbatsky.</p>
